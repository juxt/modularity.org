A blog site based on [Start Bootstrap's clean-blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) design. I run my own blog on this template, [malcolmsparks.com](http://malcolmsparks.com). The nice thing is that it's very minimal and once you're confident with Clojure you can personalise it however you wish.

Projects generated with this template get the following features 'out of the box'.

* Markdown-formatted posts in the `posts` directory (although this location is configurable), formatted using [endophile](https://github.com/theJohnnyBrown/endophile)
* The option to run the website live, or generate the static content - it's up to you! (except the static content generation bit isn't yet finished)
* A built-in [less](http://lesscss.org/) compiler, giving you the scope to greatly personalise the design
* As with all other modular projects, a highly productive  [re-settable](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded) workflow
* With a [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component)-based architecture, easy to modify and add/replace functionality without the project turning into a [big ball of mud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud)
* All the benefits of the Clojure language, such as performance, functional programming, pervasive immutable data structures and more

All this in less than 500 lines of code :)
