## Alternatives

There are other projects based on [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) that are providing pre-written components which are compatible with modular.

* Daniel Szmulewicz's [system](https://github.com/danielsz/system) project comprises a number of components for libraries not yet supported by modular.
