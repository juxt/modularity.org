Templates are free modular applications that give you a complete
Clojure-based project to build upon. Unlike many templating systems
which generate code that is hard to change, these templates leave you
with a simple open architecture which supports change and growth.

Templates are driven from data held in a manifest file within modular's lein-template resources directory, and so new templates can be added: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juxt/modular/master/lein-template/resources/manifest.edn
